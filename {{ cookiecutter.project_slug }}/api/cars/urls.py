# In your generated project, open `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/api/cars/urls.py`
# Replace its entire content with the following (it will be much simpler):

# This file no longer needs to define a router or urlpatterns.
# It simply serves as a module for the CarViewSet, which is imported by api/urls.py.
# from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter # This line is no longer needed
from .views import CarViewSet  # Keep this import, as api/urls.py needs it
# No router or urlpatterns defined here anymore
